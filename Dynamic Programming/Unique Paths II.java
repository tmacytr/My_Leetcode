/*
    Follow up for "Unique Paths":
    Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
    An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
    For example,
    There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.


    [
      [0,0,0],
      [0,1,0],
      [0,0,0]
    ]
    The total number of unique paths is 2.
