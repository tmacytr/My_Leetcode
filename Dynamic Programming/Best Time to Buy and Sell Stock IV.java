/*
	The basic idea is to create two tables. hold and unhold.

	hold[i][j] means the maximum profit with at most j transaction for 0 to i-th day. 
	hold means you have a stock in your hand.

	unhold[i][j] means the maximum profit with at most j transaction for 0 to i-th day. 
	unhold means you don't have a stock in your hand.

	The equation is
		hold[i][j] = Math.max(unhold[i-1][j]-prices[i],hold[i-1][j]);
	unhold[i][j] = Math.max(hold[i-1][j-1]+prices[i],unhold[i-1][j]);

	when you sell your stock this is a transaction but when you buy a stock, 
	it is not considered as a full transaction. so this is why the two equation look a little different.

	And we have to initiate hold table when k = 0.

	When the situation is you can not buy a new stock at the same day when you sell it. For example you can only buy a new stock after one day you sell it. The same idea. Another situation is when you have to pay a transaction fee for each transaction, just make a modification when you sell it, So just change the unhold equation a little.
