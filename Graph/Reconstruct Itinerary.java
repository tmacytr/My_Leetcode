/*
	 Reconstruct Itinerary

	 Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

	 Note:
	 If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
	 All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
	 You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
	 Example 1:
	 tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
	 Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].
	 Example 2:
	 tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
	 Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
	 Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.
