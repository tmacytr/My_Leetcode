/*
	Subtree
	You have two every large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.

	Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
	Example
	T2 is a subtree of T1 in the following case:

	       1                3
	      / \              / 
	T1 = 2   3      T2 =  4
	        /
	       4
	T2 isn't a subtree of T1 in the following case:

	       1               3
	      / \               \
	T1 = 2   3       T2 =    4
	        /
	       4
	Note
	A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
