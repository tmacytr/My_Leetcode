	Cosine Similarity
	Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0Â° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle.

	See wiki: Cosine Similarity

	Here is the formula:

	/media/problem/cosine-similarity.png

	Given two vectors A and B with the same size, calculate the cosine similarity.

	Return 2.0000 if cosine similarity is invalid (for example A = [0] and B = [0]).

	Example
	Given A = [1, 2, 3], B = [2, 3 ,4].

	Return 0.9926.

	Given A = [0], B = [0].

	Return 2.0000
