    406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

    Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

    Note:
    The number of people is less than 1,100.


    Example

    Input:
    [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

    Output:
    [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

// Solution1: extra space, greedy, 给队列先排个序，按照身高高的排前面，如果身高相同，则第二个数小的排前面。然后我们新建一个空的数组，遍历之前排好序的数组，然后根据每个元素的第二个数字，将其插入到res数组中对应的位置
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0]);
        List<int[]> res = new LinkedList();
        for (int[] cur : people) {
            res.add(cur[1], cur);
        }
        return res.toArray(people);
    }
